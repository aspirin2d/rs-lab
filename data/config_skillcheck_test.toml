occupation="Journalist"
backstory="""
You are an ex-marine who served during the initial phases of the Afghan war, but stopped serving after your unit was wiped out by an IED. Although you survived without any severe or life altering physical injuries, the incident plagued you with Tinnitus and PTSD. Its effects gradually consume all you hold dear in your life, work, wife, kids, and even a good night's rest. Now you scrape by life with what little you have left, knee deep in debt, living life a day at a time. A year ago, you started trying out your luck at abandoned self-storages, making bets on whatever self-storages were given up by their owners due to eviction or death. So far, it has kept you afloat, but the previous purchase did not come close to cover the cost of purchasing the storage.
