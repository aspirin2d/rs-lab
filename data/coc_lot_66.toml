You arrived at an old self-storage facility by invitation from the manager, who has an storage room up for auction due to the death of its owner. It is not your first rodeo with these forms of auctions, like a box of chocolate, no one knows of the potential treasure that hides behind the cold roller shutter. As you and other interested buyers gathered around the auctioneer, a worker carrying a bolt cutter snapped off the rusty lock, unveiling a storage room cluttered with various old furniture and antiquities. Without any opportunity for the bidders to take a clear look, the auctioneer began the bid at $50. 

What is your bid?

possible actions:
1. $100.
2. $150.

You follow the manager through the myriad hallways to his dimly lit office, where the furnishings and appliances remain unchanged since the 90’s. He often reminds you that the facility is in fact even older, and has been here since the 60’s. You made a quick phone call to Alex, a man you owe money to, and explained to him that you will pay him back in a few days once you have it, to which he responded with distasteful threats. The manager took out an old tin box and placed it on his desk and reached towards you with an open palm, gesturing for you to pay up, which you obliged. Upon handing you a key for your newly owned storage room, he urged you to watch some old security footage.

Through his CRT screen, he explains to you that the previous owner visited the storage room every day for as long as he can remember. What’s even stranger is that he would hop 3 times towards the storage before entering, and would always bring a paper bag with him, and it would always be empty when he leaves. 

Regardless of the strange footage and information, you went to the parking lot to grab your duffle bag so that you may start clearing the storage and look for things valuable to sell. As you are walking back, you are confronted by a middle-aged woman, she requests that you give her access to her lot, which you purchased last time so that she may recover her old family silver locket.

What is your next step?

possible actions:
1. Reject her
2. Accept her request but lose out on potential earnings
3. Ignore her completely

As you continue to rummage through the newly acquired storage room, you come across a peculiar round wooden block with intricate yet strange carvings around the thick edges. One particular feature that stands out among all others is the fine pentagram inlay in the center, coupled with clean carvings of unfamiliar symbols. Even an untrained eye can recognize the quality of craftsmanship and time committed to produce such an object, yet, you have doubts as to how much this table-like wooden block can fetch. 

You discovered a few more expensive looking objects and placed it inside your duffle bag, then proceeded to carefully load the peculiar wooden block onto your truck. Just as you closed the tailgates, you suddenly found yourself knocked on the hard gravel floor. Your lips, bleeding profusely from a cut, and as you look up, you realize it was Alex.

The manager hands you some gauze and a bottle of rubbing alcohol as the blood drips down the sink while you clean yourself up in the restroom. You focus on the stinging pain of the alcohol on your cut lips, reminding you how unfair life could be, and that life would relentlessly beat men like you down until your spirit breaks.

You stared long and hard at yourself in the mirror before closing the wound with a closure strip and covered it with another layer of gauze. The manager, sympathetic to your predicament, recommended you to a dealer that specializes in collecting esoteric and abstruse items. 

You make your way to the address given by the self-storage facility manager, and soon find yourself in a Victorian style house. As you roll up to the front porch, Ms. Blackwell, the aforementioned dealer greets you with a restrained annoyance.

She invites you to bring your peculiar objects to your personal library, its walls filled with books you have never seen or heard before. You placed the round wooden block on the table, along with the objects in your duffle bag, and...

Professor Dagger examines the seance table and the three leather bound books with utmost concentration and scrutiny, being as careful as possible to not inflict any damage to the items.

The Professor, in a somber tone, inquired about a fourth book, which is the rarest of them all, for it allows the user to bind a demon to the material world, to earth. But it would burst in flames after the transaction is complete, unless the Demon has been betrayed and unable to collect its debt. He concludes, altogether, along with the fourth book, these items could fetch a price well above $2,000,000. Your eyes lit up, recognizing this to be your chance to turn your life around, pay off your debts and perhaps start something by yourself.

You informed him that you found all the items in the recently acquired storage room, and suggested to the Professor that the fourth book may be misplaced in the storage. The Professor offered to help you search for the fourth book, hoping to move things along quicker.

You quickly load everything back onto your truck, and with Professor Dagger in the passenger seat, the two of you make way towards the self-storage facility. On your way there, the Professor informed you that he has a confession to make.


How do you respond?

possible actions:
1. Listen to his confession
2. Ask him to keep what he has to say to himself
3. Threaten him that if he lied about the money, you would hurt him real bad

- Kyle Jackson, despite your financial desperation, you accepted a middle-aged woman's request to access the storage room heyou had recently purchased. Upon entering the storage, Kyle discovered strange and unsettling objects, including a collection of old jars with unidentifiable contents, which he failed to appraise. His investigation led him to a hidden compartment containing maritime maps, a rusted compass, and a journal detailing a voyage to the mythical R'lyeh, driving him to the brink of madness. As Kyle loses control, haunted by the implications of his findings, he hears a strange noise, indicating that something else is present in the storage room with him.

You invited Professor Dagger into the storage room, and the two of you began scouring through old furniture, leaving nothing unturned, yet, after two long hours, your hands held nothing but dust. You sensed the Professor’s eyes laced with disappointment, perhaps he has already given up the search, but your desire for a better life fuels your persistence to hunt the fourth book down. You revisit the drawers you may have overlooked, potential compartments that are hidden behind intricate mechanisms like the seance table. As you attempt to wrestle a large wooden shelf to another wall, your slip of the hand causes it to collide with the wall behind it, producing a hollow thud. Professor Dagger immediately placed his hands against the false wall, sliding across its surface gently like one would a body. Soon he senses the concealed mechanism that held the secret shut, which upon a soft press, unveils a dark corridor effluviating a pungent scent.

Before entering, Professor Dagger warns you not to look or speak to whatever resides at the end of the corridor, for you may enter a state of frenzy. With that in mind, you follow Professor Dagger into the unknown…

You are an ex-marine who served during the initial phases of the Afghan war, but stopped serving after your unit was wiped out by an IED. Although you survived without any severe or life altering physical injuries, the incident plagued you with Tinnitus and PTSD. Its effects gradually consume all you hold dear in your life, work, wife, kids, and even a good night's rest. Now you scrape by life with what little you have left, knee deep in debt, living life a day at a time. A year ago, you started trying out your luck at abandoned self-storages, making bets on whatever self-storages were given up by their owners due to eviction or death. So far, it has kept you afloat, but the previous purchase did not come close to cover the cost of purchasing the storage.
