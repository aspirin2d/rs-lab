## What is Call of Cthulhu?
*Call of Cthulhu* is a horror-themed roleplaying game 
concerning both horrors from beyond and from within.

Playing the roles of steadfast investigators, you and your 
friends will travel to strange and dangerous places, uncover 
foul plots, and stand against the terrors of the night. Within 
strange and forgotten tomes of lore you may discover secrets 
that humanity was not meant to know. Along the way, sanityblasting
 monsters and insane cultists work to bring about 
your demise. You and your companions may well decide the 
fate of the world!
