The night was heavy with the promise of rain, a fitting prelude to the call that would shatter the uneasy peace of your evening. The phone rings, a shrill intrusion into the quiet. You answer it, and a voice, rough and strained, echoes through the static.

"Is this Joe Doe?" The voice is male, with an edge of desperation that sets your nerves on edge. "My name is Warden Blackwood. I'm calling from Miskatonic Penitentiary. We need your helpâ€”strange things have been happening here, things I ... can't explain."
