You arrived at an old self-storage facility by invitation from the manager, who has an storage room up for auction due to the death of its owner. It is not your first rodeo with these forms of auctions, like a box of chocolate, no one knows of the potential treasure that hides behind the cold roller shutter. As you and other interested buyers gathered around the auctioneer, a worker carrying a bolt cutter snapped off the rusty lock, unveiling a storage room cluttered with various old furniture and antiquities. Without any opportunity for the bidders to take a clear look, the auctioneer began the bid at $50.

You follow the manager through the myriad hallways to his dimly lit office, where the furnishings and appliances remain unchanged since the 90’s. He often reminds you that the facility is in fact even older, and has been here since the 60’s. You made a quick phone call to Alex, a man you owe money to, and explained to him that you will pay him back in a few days once you have it, to which he responded with distasteful threats. The manager took out an old tin box and placed it on his desk and reached towards you with an open palm, gesturing for you to pay up, which you obliged. Upon handing you a key for your newly owned storage room, he urged you to watch some old security footage.

Through his CRT screen, he explains to you that the previous owner visited the storage room every day for as long as he can remember. What’s even stranger is that he would hop 3 times towards the storage before entering, and would always bring a paper bag with him, and it would always be empty when he leaves. 

Regardless of the strange footage and information, you went to the parking lot to grab your duffle bag so that you may start clearing the storage and look for things valuable to sell. As you are walking back, you are confronted by a middle-aged woman, she requests that you give her access to her lot, which you purchased last time so that she may recover her old family silver locket.

What is your next step?

1. Reject her

As you continue to rummage through the newly acquired storage room, you come across a peculiar round wooden block with intricate yet strange carvings around the thick edges. One particular feature that stands out among all others is the fine pentagram inlay in the center, coupled with clean carvings of unfamiliar symbols. Even an untrained eye can recognize the quality of craftsmanship and time committed to produce such an object, yet, you have doubts as to how much this table-like wooden block can fetch. 

You discovered a few more expensive looking objects and placed it inside your duffle bag, then proceeded to carefully load the peculiar wooden block onto your truck. Just as you closed the tailgates, you suddenly found yourself knocked on the hard gravel floor. Your lips, bleeding profusely from a cut, and as you look up, you realize it was Alex.

The manager hands you some gauze and a bottle of rubbing alcohol as the blood drips down the sink while you clean yourself up in the restroom. You focus on the stinging pain of the alcohol on your cut lips, reminding you how unfair life could be, and that life would relentlessly beat men like you down until your spirit breaks. Yet, the pain simultaneously fuels your will to survive, to live on, a chance that the people you fought in the Afghan war never had. In a way, you live on for their sake, trying to be grateful despite the hardship that has plagued you ever since your honorable discharge. 

You stared long and hard at yourself in the mirror before closing the wound with a closure strip and covered it with another layer of gauze. The manager, sympathetic to your predicament, recommended you to a dealer that specializes in collecting esoteric and abstruse items. You felt insulted by his act of pity, but reluctantly agreed as you weighed your current situation to your pride. 

You make your way to the address given by the self-storage facility manager, and soon find yourself in a Victorian style house. Although the sun had set, the glow of the incandescent porch light revealed the house’s burgundy coloured exterior with black accent. As you roll up to the front porch, Ms. Blackwell, the aforementioned dealer greets you with a restrained annoyance. But you couldn’t be bothered by her attitude, such is the norm of most dealers you have met with, rarely do they find an item of great value after all. 

She invites you to bring your peculiar objects to your personal library, its walls filled with books you have never seen or heard before. You placed the round wooden block on the table, along with the objects in your duffle bag, and...

Professor Dagger examines the seance table with utmost concentration and scrutiny, being as careful as possible to not inflict any damage to the table. He then shifted his attention to the three leather bound books, inspecting its condition while flipping through its contents to verify its authenticity. 

After much inspection, he turned his attention towards you, and inquired about a fourth book, expressing that altogether, it could fetch a price well above $2,000,000. Your eyes lit up, recognizing this to be your chance to turn your life around, pay off your debts and perhaps start something by yourself. The mystery of the fourth book piqued your interest despite the disinterest in the occult, and such curiosity beckoned you to ask about the importance of the fourth book. A heavy silence ensued, the Professor’s shadowy face under the chandelier’s soft  glow gazed into your eyes with great earnestness. In a somber tone, he explained that the fourth book is the rarest of them all, for it allows its user to bind a demon to the material world, to earth. And the moment the transaction is complete, the book would self combust to a pile of ash unless the demon has been betrayed and unable to collect its debt, thus explaining the price of the book. 

You hastily explain your recently acquired storage, and how you still haven’t had the opportunity to thoroughly examine every item, suggesting its possible location. Professor Dagger offered to search the storage room alongside you, and if the fourth book is found, he will write you a $2,000,000 cheque immediately. 

You quickly load everything back onto your truck, and with Professor Dagger in the passenger seat, the two of you make way towards the self-storage facility. On your way there, the Professor informed you that he has a confession to make.

How do you respond?

possible actions:

You invited Professor Dagger into the storage room, the space still cluttered despite your earlier attempt to clear some of the items out. The two of you began scouring through old furniture, leaving nothing unturned, yet, after two long hours, your hands held nothing but dust. You sensed the Professor’s eyes laced with disappointment, perhaps he has already given up the search, for to encounter a rare artifact like the one he described must require great deal of luck. But your desire for a better life fuels your persistence to hunt the fourth book down. You revisit the drawers you may have overlooked, potential compartments that are hidden behind intricate mechanisms like the seance table. And as you attempt to wrestle a large wooden shelf to another wall, your slip of the hand causes it to collide with the wall behind it, producing a hollow thud. Professor Dagger immediately placed his hands against the false wall, sliding across its surface gently like one would a body. Soon he senses the concealed mechanism that safeguards the secret shut, which upon a gentle press, unveils a dark corridor effluviating a pungent scent.

Before entering, Professor Dagger warns you not to look or speak to whatever resides at the end of the corridor, for you may enter a state of frenzy. With that in mind, you follow Professor Dagger into the unknown…

What is your next course of action?

backstory="""
You are an ex-marine who served during the initial phases of the Afghan war, but stopped serving after your unit was wiped out by an IED. Although you survived without any severe or life altering physical injuries, the incident plagued you with Tinnitus and PTSD. Its effects gradually consume all you hold dear in your life, work, wife, kids, and even a good night's rest. Now you scrape by life with what little you have left, knee deep in debt, living life a day at a time. A year ago, you started trying out your luck at abandoned self-storages, making bets on whatever self-storages were given up by their owners due to eviction or death. So far, it has kept you afloat, but the previous purchase did not come close to cover the cost of purchasing the storage.
