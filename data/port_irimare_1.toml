Here is the CONTEXT of the round:
\"\"\"
- The year is 1925, under a dark moonless night, you are riding on a bus towards Port Irimare with two other passengers. The road is flooded by a thick fog, yet, the old man behind the wheel zip through the winding road as if he had done this a thousand times. 
The danger worries you slightly but you can’t help enjoying the thrill of it. Suddenly, you felt the old man slam on the brakes. You jerked forward and back after you felt the entire vehicle collide with something. 
The sound of the crash was loud, and the screeching noise of metal tearing through metal was just all too familiar, and that moment you knew the old man had collided with another vehicle. 
You and the other two passengers climbed out from the window of the wrecked bus and investigated the wreckage. 
The front of the bus had crumpled inwards and had completely crushed the old bus driver. What was once recognizable could only now be described as pounded flesh. 
The other vehicle was a police car, but there was nobody inside. Given that Port Irimare was not too far away and could be reached by foot, the three of you had decided to make your way to the town to report the incident. 
As you near the town entrance, the thick fog continued to linger, and it wasn’t until you were around five meters away from the map board did the three of you notice a police officer.
After explaining the situation, the four of you decided to establish contact with the proper authority so that you may all call for help and not be stranded in this isolated fishing town, all the while trying to uncover the potential gold hidden in Port Irimare.

backstory="""
You are a bootlegger for a Mafia in a nearby town, and you nearly got caught by the police on your previous run. Although you had escaped the law, the liquor hidden in the automobile was confiscated and disposed of. 
Furious with your mistake, the Mafia threatens to slit you and your younger brother’s throat if you do not pay back what was lost. 
Your life wasn’t always like this. Before the prohibition, you had a business in trading liquor, but that was quickly closed down by law enforcement. 
Any liquor that you previously stocked was all poured down the drain by the police, leaving you with nothing. 
Your parents are not the smartest individuals, and work elsewhere, but could only sustain their own living. Thus, you have been responsible for your younger brother’s well being ever since you were able to make some good money. 
With the business gone, you became a bootlegger for the ludicrous payout, which was mainly to support your brother’s education cost and living cost.
During this time as a bootlegger, you had spent a lot of time in the night with moonshiners, and they frequently shared strange stories and rumors. 
One of the men once spoke of this isolated place called Port Irimare, and claimed that they somehow amassed a great deal of wealth in a span of a year. 
He even went on saying that he had seen them export crates of gold, and promised that he was not drunk when he saw it. 
You were skeptical before and treated it as another made up story, but with your current situation, perhaps it is not such a bad idea to check to see if the rumors are true. 
You decided to visit Port Irimare and find an opportunity to steal some gold to pay back the debt that you owe.
